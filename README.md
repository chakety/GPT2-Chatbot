SJSU AI Chatbot

This project aims to design a web application for SJSU students who need an online quick assistant and advising. The web page doesnâ€™t need any login info to keep user information, and our chatbot will provide fundamental question and answer skills to college users.

How to run the project
1. run the requirement.txt file, pip install -r requirement.txt
2. download model from google drive, replace the model in the models/345_org.
3. run the main.py, python main.py.
4. open the browser, go to localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
5. enter the question in the text bar, and click send, few seconds later, the chatbot will get response.
