# SJSU AI Chatbot

This project aims to design a web application for SJSU students who need an online quick assistant and advising. The web page doesnâ€™t need any login info to keep user information, and our chatbot will provide fundamental question and answer skills to college users.

**## How to run the project**
1. run the requirement.txt file, pip install -r requirement.txt
2. download model file called model from google drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_1n2CdniG9UY4QEEr7g4WKkOVHWmjRPx?usp=sharing, replace the model in the models/345_org
3. run the main.py, python main.py
4. open the browser, go to localhost:5000 or http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
5. enter the question in the text bar, and click send, few seconds later, the chatbot will get response.

    How are enrollment appointments determined?
    What if there is a Time Conflicting?
